-  Project Title: Location Prediction using Markov Chain and Folium

-  Overview:
This project is focused on using Markov Chain and Folium to predict the location of a person based on their history location data. The data will be preprocessed and analyzed using NumPy, then trained using Markov Chain, and finally visualized using Folium to display the predicted location on a map.

Dependencies:

-  NumPy
- Folium
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Installation:

Ensure that Python is installed on your computer.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Install the dependencies using pip or conda package manager.
pip install numpy folium pandas matplotlib
conda install numpy folium pandas matplotlib
-  Usage:

Download or clone the project from the Github repository.
Open the command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the "main.py" script using the following command: "python main.py"
The program will ask for the location history file path, which should be a CSV file containing latitude, longitude, and time information.
Once the file is loaded, the program will analyze the data and train the Markov Chain model.
After the model is trained, the program will prompt the user to enter a starting location.
Once the starting location is entered, the program will predict the next location based on the Markov Chain model.
The predicted location will be displayed on a map using Folium.
